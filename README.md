# Q-Learning Pirate Maze

### What code were you given?
* I was given two .py files which contained one class, TreasureMaze.py, to represent the environment which includes a maze object defined as a matrix and a second class, GameExperience.py, that stores all of the states that come between the initial state and the terminal state. The provided .ipynb file contains all the code for setting up the parameters of the game such as the actions that can be taken by the agent, the structure of the maze matrix, and the code for the neural network layer model.
